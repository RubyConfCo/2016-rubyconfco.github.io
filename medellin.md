# MEDELLÍN WILL HOST RUBYCONF COLOMBIA 2016

Medellín is the second largest city in [Colombia.](http://wikitravel.org/en/Colombia) It has over 3 million people and is the capital of the department of [Antioquia.](http://wikitravel.org/en/Antioquia) The weather in Medellín is considered to be mild, hence it being known as the 'City of everlasting spring'. Average daily temperatures are 22ºC (71ºF) , range from 15 to 30 degrees Celsius (60º-85ºF).

### Airports

Medellin has two main airports - Jose Maria Cordova International Airport and Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport.

*   The international airport (Jose Maria Cordova) is located about 29km from Medellin in Rionegro.*   The local airport (Enrique Olaya Herrera) is located within the city although only small regional flights depart/land from there.

### Getting from Jose Maria Cordova airport to the city

1\. Taxis - You will see blue and white taxis located outside the doors when you exit the airport. Although all taxis in Medellin use taxi-meters, the ride to/from the airport is fixed at $60.000COP or a bit more depending on which part of the city your are going to. However, just to be on the safe side, make sure to ask the taxi driver the price before leaving the airport.

2\. Colectivos (small buses) - These are shared taxis or mini-buses also located just outside when you exit. Colectivos cost $15.000 COP per person from the airport to El Poblado.

**Note:** Colectivos will NOT drop you off directly at your destination. Instead they will drop you in front of San Diego Mall. We suggest taking a taxi from this point to your destination.
